# Honors Thesis Overview
Here, I have ordered scripts that form part of the HPC variant calling pipeline I constructed. I have also included scripts used for my Honors Thesis' Redundancy Analysis-based Genome-Environment Association. There are also additional scripts from smaller side projects I completed during that time.

Preliminary work was made possible thanks to my Rose Hills sponsors. Information about this work completed under the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship can be found here: https://live-ours.pantheon.berkeley.edu/surf-fellows/victor-canta-gallo/
